# This file is only used to set redirects and headers. Build settings are set
# in the UI because we are deploying two sites, the application and storybook docs.

# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds â€“ they do not get scoped to
# contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files, which are
# PER-DEPLOY.

# Allow easier access to the storybook site for now. If a domain is purchased
# then URL masking can be used to redirect and keep the same site name.
