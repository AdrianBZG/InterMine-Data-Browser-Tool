# Quick Start

## Preparation

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository
2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JM-Mendez/InterMine-Data-Browser-Tool.git
```

### Install Dependencies

This project uses `yarn berry` for package management. Make sure to have it
globally installed before proceeding.

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

If you run `yarn -v`, the version will show as `v1`. Yet, this project
will automatically use `v2 berry`.

Now enter the repo's directory

```sh
cd InterMine-Data-Browser-Tool
```

Then install the dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Development

This project uses `storybook` for developing components in isolation, as well for
documentation.

There is usually no need to have both `storybook` and the app open in the
terminal at the same time. You can, but doing so will most likely consume more resources
than is required.

After running the approriate command, the browser will open to the local development url.
If you wish to view the application in a mobile browser, for instance to work on
responsiveness, then use the provided network url on your mobile device.

### Developing Components

```sh
yarn storybook
```

### Developing the Application

```sh
yarn start
```

### Testing

This project uses [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
to test the UI components. Familiarity with this library is highly recommended.

By running the following command, you can execute tests in watch mode. On a CI server, tests will exit
upon completion.

```sh
yarn test
```

If you haven't already, now would be a good time to learn how we
style the application in our <LinkTo kind='docs-styling-color-palette--page'>styleguide</LinkTo>.
